// This tool takes an IP address as a string.  If the IP address is IPv4 it
// returns it unchanged.  If it is IPv6 it returns it with square brackets.
//
// Writing this in C++ might seem like overkill.  However,
// - parsing using a regular expression (and sed) is surprisingly complicated
// - there is a bug in Python that makes it hang on occasion
// - this code is very rarely changed, so maintainability is not a big concern.

#include <arpa/inet.h>
